# hello-world
I'm Dave, and though I never have done software development professionally, I do enjoy dabbling and learning about PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the many associated bits like .htaccess, mySQL, Apache, TLS/SSL, and on and on.
This is a brief explore of Github for me because I want to use a phpFlickr library that is stored here. 
But it also recommends use of Packagist, so it's not clear that I'll use Github or simply use Composer to pull what I need.
